# demos

This repository contains demo projects on different topics. Each project has a dockerfile and could be tested.

## Contents

### Forms

These two projects contain identical web forms. The first is built in pure html/css/js. The second is built with Vue 3.

The forms represent a common example of a web form with different types of input controls, with validation and basic accessability.

These demos show that Vue helps a lot to reduce the amount of html and it helps to follow the DRY principle in writing your html. Though it doesn't help much in the task of reducing the amount of js in this basic example. The form validation could be fully implemented with only using web browser API.
